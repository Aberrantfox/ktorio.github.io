Ktor 0.9.3 fixes some bugs, improves the overall performance of the server, partially starts supporting JVM 9,
and introduces new APIs and changes for some of them.

In this section, we will discuss how to convert existing code from 0.9.2 to 0.9.3.

### Optional Authentication

Now it is possible to define a set of routes where you can provide authentication, but it is optional:

```kotlin
authenticate("method", optional = true) {
    // routes
}
```

The authenticate behaviour:

* No authentication provided:
  * `optional=false`: challenge is performed
  * `optional=true`: route handler is executed with principal=null
* Wrong credentials: Unauthorized
* Valid credentials: route handler is executed with the principal generated from the authentication method 

### Missing call.respondBytes

Before 0.9.3 we had `call.respondText` but missed `call.respondBytes`. We have solved this.

### TLS improvements

Ktor implements secure sockets using [CIO](/quickstart/faq.html#cio), and the TLS available
before 0.9.3 missed some cypher suites and encryption methods. We have updated it to support more required stuff.

Some errors you could encounter that now might be fixed:

* `Exception in thread "io-thread-1" io.ktor.network.tls.TLSException: Received alert during handshake. Level: FATAL, code: HandshakeFailure`
* `Exception in thread "io-thread-2" io.ktor.network.tls.TLSException: Unsupported TLS handshake type CertificateRequest`

### client-mock-engine

We had a `MockEngine` available internally for our tests for creating an HttpClient that was able to respond
from our code programmatically without actually performing any request.

We have now exposed it.

For example:

```kotlin
val mockEngine = MockEngine { call -> // suspend HttpRequest.(call: HttpClientCall) -> MockHttpResponse
    assertEquals("*/*", headers[HttpHeaders.Accept])

    MockHttpResponse(call, HttpStatusCode.OK, writer(ioCoroutineDispatcher) { channel.writeStringUtf8("HELLO") }.channel, headersOf(
        "X-Custom-Header" to listOf("value")
    ))
}

val client = HttpClient(mockEngine)
```

Inside the MockEngine block, you can assert things from the request, or decide how to generate a response based on
the request.  


### New ktor-samples repository

Before 0.9.3, we had several sample projects integrated directly in the ktor repository.
They have grown, and we have moved them to their own repository: <https://github.com/ktorio/ktor-samples>
