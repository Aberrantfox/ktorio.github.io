Ktor 0.9.3 fixes some bugs, improves the overall performance of the server, partially starts supporting JVM 9,
and introduces new APIs and changes for some of them.

### Missing call.respondBytes

Before 0.9.3 we had `call.respondText` but missed `call.respondBytes`. We have solved this.

### TLS improvements

Ktor implements secure sockets using [CIO](/quickstart/faq.html#cio), and the TLS available
before 0.9.3 missed some cypher suites and encryption methods. We have updated it to support more required stuff.

Some errors you could encounter that now might be fixed:

* `Exception in thread "io-thread-1" io.ktor.network.tls.TLSException: Received alert during handshake. Level: FATAL, code: HandshakeFailure`
* `Exception in thread "io-thread-2" io.ktor.network.tls.TLSException: Unsupported TLS handshake type CertificateRequest`

### New ktor-samples repository

Before 0.9.3, we had several sample projects integrated directly in the ktor repository.
They have grown, and we have moved them to their own repository: <https://github.com/ktorio/ktor-samples>
